categorical,Categorical,The values are categorical rather than continuous valued quantities.,,Adapted from CUAHSI HIS DataTypeCV.  See http://his.cuahsi.org/mastercvreg/edit_cv11.aspx?tbl=DataTy,,
confidenceInterval,Confidence Interval,"In statistics, a confidence interval (CI) is a type of interval estimate of a statistical parameter. It is an observed interval (i.e., it is calculated from the observations), in principle different from sample to sample, that frequently includes the value of an unobservable parameter of interest if the experiment is repeated. How frequently the observed interval contains the parameter is determined by the confidence level or confidence coefficient.",,Wikipedia,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confidence_interval,
constantOverInterval,Constant over interval,"The values are quantities that can be interpreted as constant for all time, or over the time interval to a subsequent measurement of the same variable at the same site.",,Adapted from CUAHSI HIS DataTypeCV.

sporadic,Sporadic,"The phenomenon is sampled at a particular instant in time but with a frequency that is too coarse for interpreting the record as continuous. This would be the case when the spacing is significantly larger than the support and the time scale of fluctuation of the phenomenon, such as for example infrequent water quality samples.",,Adapted from CUAHSI HIS DataTypeCV.
